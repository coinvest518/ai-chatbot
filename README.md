AI Chatbot Project | Learn AI and Coding Mini Course
Welcome to the AI Chatbot project repository! This project is part of the "Learn AI and Coding Mini Course" where we build a simple chatbot web app from scratch using AI-assisted tools. Whether you're new to coding or have some experience, this hands-on project will guide you through the process of creating a chatbot and understanding the fundamentals of AI integration.

üìñ About the Course
In this mini-course, you'll:

Learn about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and coding basics.
Use React to build the frontend for your chatbot.
Implement OpenAI API to power the chatbot's conversations.
Leverage various tools like Vercel V0, GitHub, and AI coding assistants to streamline development.
Teaching, to me, is about making things easy and simple to understand. As Einstein said, "If you can‚Äôt explain it simply, you don‚Äôt understand it well enough." This course is built from trial and effort, focusing on actual hands-on learning in building, testing, and deploying the chatbot.

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

Code Editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
