# AI Chatbot Project | Learn AI and Coding Mini Course

Welcome to the **AI Chatbot** project repository! This project is part of the *"Learn AI and Coding Mini Course"* where we build a simple chatbot web app from scratch using AI-assisted tools. Whether you're new to coding or have some experience, this hands-on project will guide you through the process of creating a chatbot and understanding the fundamentals of AI integration.

## üìñ About the Course

In this mini-course, you'll:
- Learn about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and coding basics.
- Use **React** to build the frontend for your chatbot.
- Implement **OpenAI API** to power the chatbot's conversations.
- Leverage various tools like **Vercel V0**, **GitHub**, and AI coding assistants to streamline development.
  
**Teaching, to me, is about making things easy and simple to understand.** As Einstein said, "If you can‚Äôt explain it simply, you don‚Äôt understand it well enough." This course is built from trial and effort, focusing on actual hands-on learning in building, testing, and deploying the chatbot.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- **Code Editor** (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Git** for version control
- **OpenAI API Key** (You can get it [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup))

### Tools Used
- **React**: Frontend framework
- **Vercel V0**: AI code generation for quick start
- **OpenAI API**: Natural language processing for chatbot responses
- **GitHub**: Version control and hosting

## üíª Installation & Setup

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coinvest518/ai-chatbot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ai-chatbot
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up your OpenAI API key**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
     ```
     REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```

5. **Run the app locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The chatbot will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
